# Hi, I'm David

**Data & GIS Specialist** at the [Swiss Federal Office for Buildings and Logistics (BBL)](https://www.bbl.admin.ch/de) in Bern, designing data architectures and integration solutions for Swiss federal real estate management.

I build solutions that bridge enterprise data management, GIS and BIM - from metadata standards to interactive visualizations. Most of my projects follow a no-framework philosophy: vanilla JavaScript and a focus on Swiss data sovereignty.
